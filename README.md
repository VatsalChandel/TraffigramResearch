# isochrone.ipynb
This is a Jupyter Notebook where users can get a better understanding of what an Isochrone is and how it will be useful to our final product. Here you pass in 2 coordinates and a time in seconds. The Notebook will then create multiple isochrones in between the two coordinates showing you if they are reachable in the given time frame

# LeafletWork
This is a simple HTML, JavaScript, CSS project in which I was experimenting with leaflet and trying to deduce the pixel coordinates of a given latitude and longitude. This experiment allowed us to get the pixel coordinates and then will further help us 'bend' the map to get our perfect circles.
